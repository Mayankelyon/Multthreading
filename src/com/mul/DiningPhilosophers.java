// Problem Statement
//5 philosophers sit around a round table.
//Each has 1 plate of food and needs 2 chopsticks to eat.
//Between each philosopher, thereâ€™s 1 chopstick (so 5 in total).
//They alternate between thinking and eating.
//Challenge: Prevent deadlock (where all philosophers pick one chopstick and wait forever).
//Naive (Deadlock-prone) Solution
//Each philosopher tries to pick left chopstick first, then right.
//This can cause deadlock if all 5 pick left at the same time.
//Deadlock-free Solution (Odd/Even strategy)
//Philosophers with even index pick left then right.
//Philosophers with odd index pick right then left.
//This prevents circular waiting.
