# ðŸš€ Java Multithreading Examples

This project demonstrates **core multithreading concepts in Java** through hands-on examples.  
It covers both **classic interview problems** and **modern concurrency utilities** from `java.util.concurrent`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features & Examples

### ðŸ”¹ Basics
- Thread creation (`Runnable` and `Thread`).
- Race condition demo & need for synchronization.
- Synchronized counter (thread-safe increment).

### ðŸ”¹ Classic Problems
- Producerâ€“Consumer (using `wait/notify` and `BlockingQueue`).
- Dining Philosophers (deadlock-free solution).
- Oddâ€“Even Printer (two threads printing alternately).
- Round-Robin Printer (M threads printing 1â€“N in sequence).
- FizzBuzz with 4 threads.

### ðŸ”¹ Concurrency Utilities
- **CountDownLatch** â†’ Wait for multiple services before starting system.
- **CyclicBarrier** â†’ Multiple threads wait for each other to reach a point.
- **ExecutorService** â†’ Manage a pool of threads.
- **Parallel Array Sum** â†’ Divide-and-conquer using thread pool.
- **Thread-Safe Singleton** (volatile + double-checked locking).

### ðŸ”¹ Asynchronous Programming
- **CompletableFuture** â†’ Async tasks with callbacks.
- **thenCompose() chaining** â†’ Execute dependent async tasks.
